Description: Signed distance fields (SDF) are a means of defining implicit surfaces with 
    distance equations.  These fields have positive values outside the surface
    of an object and negative values inside - the surface of the object is 
    defined where the field evaluates to zero.  Fields can be combined with 
    Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) boolean operations to form more 
    complex shapes.  The provided renderer will create a snapshot of
    the field using isometric cubes.
